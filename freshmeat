synchronize mailboxes between a pop and an imap servers.

pop2imap is a tool for facilitating incremental
POP to IMAP transfers from one mailbox to
another. It is useful for mailbox migration, and
reduces the amount of data transferred by only
copying messages that are not present on both
servers.  The process can be stopped and
resumed. The original messages can optionally be
deleted after a successful transfer.
