DESCRIPTION
    The command pop2imap is a tool allowing incremental transfer from one
    POP3 mailbox to an IMAP one.

    We sometimes need to transfer mailboxes from one POP3 server an IMAP
    server. This is called migration.

    pop2imap is the adequate tool because it reduces the amount of data
    transfered by not transferring a given message if it is already on both
    sides. You can stop the transfer at any time and restart it later,
    pop2imap is adapted to a bad connection.

    You can decide to delete the messages from the source mailbox after a
    successful transfer (it is a good feature when migrating). In that case,
    use the --delete option.

    You can also just synchronize a mailbox A from another mailbox B in case
    you just want to keep a "live" copy of B in A.
